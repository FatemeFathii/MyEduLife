# Timeline Activity

We collaboratively created a timeline of events that are important for us. Here were some insights for us:

* The technology keeps changing.
* But the technology goes beyond identity.
* Society impacts tech & tech impacts society.
* And we gathered emotional stuff (like Hate, Fear, Fascism) in the present, not the past.
   * We remember tech, but not the emotions!
* Technology artifacts are long-lived, much more than emotions.
* We see the positive of the past, but more negatives in the future.
* Correction & feedback loop from technology is much faster than it was historically.
* Regulation is coming up in the present.
