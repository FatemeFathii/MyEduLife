# Ahas & Tips: Wednesday Morning

This morning we talked with our groups about their ahas and tips.

* Don't be afraid to just start writing something.
* If you don't have troubles writing, you still have to make sure you have structure!
* This gives us time out to research that we wouldn't have in our regular work days.
* It's easier to fight than to write!
* Everyone has their own strengths. They may not all be compatible, but they will be by the end of the day.

And we were off to groups.
