These iconic indications of progress were created at the end of the third day. They used symbology from the [Liberating Structures website](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/20-drawing-together/).

Broadly:
```
Circle = wholeness;
Rectangle = support;
Triangle = goal;
Spiral = change;
Star person [equidistant cross] = relationship
```
