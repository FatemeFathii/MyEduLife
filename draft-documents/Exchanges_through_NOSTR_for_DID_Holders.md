# Exchanges through NOSTR for DID Holders

**Authors:** Imad El Aouny & Frederic Martin

# **Abstract**:

Nostr is a simple, open protocol that enables global, decentralized, and censorship-resistant social media.

This paper explains how two DID holders can securely :
- establish end to end encrypted communication channels
- exchange credentials
- send and receive text messages
 
We will provide a simple protocol with partial implementation source code  to ensure this seamless and trusted exchanges.

The protocol follows a series of steps to ensure a seamless and trusted exchange through encrypted messages :
- Request, issue and receive Verifiable Credentials 
- Request, issue and verify Verifiable Presentations
