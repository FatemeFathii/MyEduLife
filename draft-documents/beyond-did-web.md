This paper will explore enhancing the did:web method, compare existing did:web like/enhancing methods (such as did:webplus and did:webS), and propose solutions to elevate its functionality and security. We also aim to provide a phased roadmap for the development of a secure did:web* method, if needed.


To begin, we will evaluate the current did:web specification. We will use our shared experiences implementing did:web and published articles to create an exhaustive list of the feature set and known gaps or security implications. Understanding business requirements and use cases is important. This paper explains the practical applications and  of businesses needs that did:web aims to fill. A detailed discussion on the features of did:web is presented, drawing from experiences with existing working code and real-world applications.


Additionally, we explore other did:methods that might operate under different names but offer similar functionalities, particularly those that resolve via DNS and incorporate key rotation features. Our focus remains on non-DLT based approaches, ensuring a broader applicability. We also dive into the related standardization activities undertaken by Trust over IP (ToIP) and IETF, highlighting their contributions and guidelines that shape the future of did:web.


Lastly, if needed, we hope to provide a cursory feature set to make the new did:web* the best it can be!
