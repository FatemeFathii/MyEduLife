Coming at this project from the perspective of an identity wallet provider working to establish a financially sustainable business, the core question is, "Why is it so hard?" 
We are building of a draft piece of work from RWOT11 that looked at [SSI Stakeholder mapping](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/ssi-stakeholder-mapping.md) to understand which components of the ecosystem need to be engaged to make a technical solution work commercially. We aim to define the role of the Ecosystem Coordinator in more detail based on real-world observations. What does an Ecosystem Coordinator need to be and do to make their respective ecosystem work? In which way is a provider's business model influenced by the nature and operations of the Ecosystem Coordinator? Which barriers and accelerators exist in the ecosystem?
