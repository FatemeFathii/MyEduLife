Digital systems wrestle with the same question that mankind always has:
what is truth? From a philosophical perspective, many acknowledge the 
limits of what is fundamentally knowable. However, many digital identity 
advocates pursue the goal of determining one’s “true identity” as a 
precondition for providing services. The issue with this goal is that it 
conflates what is “true”, as in what exists in objective reality, with the 
perceptions and beliefs of an individual person or system. We call this 
phenomenon “the uncanny gap”: the insurmountable difference between physical 
reality and its perception, interpretation, or representation in information 
systems. Instead of trying to close this gap, digital systems should be 
designed to establish a sense of truth that is good enough for its needs.
