This paper introduces a novel framework for the presentation of sets of related verifiable credentials that would apply for different purposes; such as infection protection, donation, or education.The framework allows individuals to assemble multiple credentials issued by different issuers and disclose them all together as one claim to stakeholders. By composing credentials together, we can extend the usual pattern of issuer, holder, and verifier. The further challenge is to generate a credible presentation that will be compelling to stakeholders such as regulators, donors, or employers. By bridging the gap between stakeholders and the world of verifiable credentials, we provide a practical and adaptable solution for a wide range of use cases. This holistic exploration of composite credentials demonstrates their potential to address and change the way credentials are presented and verified in a variety of settings.
