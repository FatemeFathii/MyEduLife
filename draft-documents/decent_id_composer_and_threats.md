## Abstract

This paper proposes that all digital identity systems are made up of three core elements: digital keys, human-readable names or data; and binding mechanisms between them. This mental model can help establish a shared understanding about the options and trade-offs that developers face when building identity solutions.

Using examples from current identity systems, we illustrate how particular design choices made about the three core elements affect the security & privacy of such systems. We explore a non-exhaustive range of options for each of the core elements, and highlight the benefits and trade-offs in each approach.

Finally, we propose a form of pseudocode configuration definition language that can be used descriptively and succinctly model design decisions. This configuration definition language is also machine-readable, and could be used to configure the set-up and operation of components of decentralized applications.
